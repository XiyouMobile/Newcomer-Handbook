# XiyouMobile Newcomer Handbook (Astro Version)

This project uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) to build a static website, displaying content from Markdown files. The main page (`index.mdx`) currently displays the content of this README.

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages upon pushes to the `main` branch.

You can view the deployed site at: [https://XiyouMobile.github.io/Newcomer-Handbook/](https://XiyouMobile.github.io/Newcomer-Handbook/)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/deploy.yml  # GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                       # Static assets (images, favicons, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.mdx             # Main page, renders README.md content
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs              # Astro configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                  # Project dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ pnpm-lock.yaml                # Exact versions of dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md                     # This file
```

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md`, or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
